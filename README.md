# DRR-18-NoSQL-Social-Network-API

## Description
I built an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. I used Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. I setup a demonstration via Thunder Client to Query the databases, adding to, and deleting from for 4 different sections - Users, Thoughts, Friends and Reactions.
